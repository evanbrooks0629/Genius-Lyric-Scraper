# Genius-Lyric-Scraper

A fun web scraper that takes in a url from genius.com and prints out the lyrics to the song.

There is some missing functionality with adding a song that I still need to sort out.

I might also consider adding the use of Selenium to go onto genius.com, search up the song name and artist, and click the first option then scrape the page to print out the lyrics.
